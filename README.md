Welcome to the Star Spangled Quiz, a quiz surrounding American History from modern day America, right through to the 18th Century. 

## Introduction

### A Brief Overview

- The purpose of the American History Quiz is to provide students and quiz-enthusiasts alike a vague introduction into American History through the means of engaging in a short but sweet quiz which has 3 levels of difficulty for the challenger. 

- The questions provided within the quiz of course all surround American historty, from rather obscure questions regarding former Presidents of the country, through to general questions concerning the geography of the 50 states, the quiz is jam packed with an array of questions where every challenger is sure to learn something new. 

### Target Audience

- The target audience of the Star Spangled Quiz are mainly history students and quiz-enthusiasts, as well as the members of the general public who enjoy engaging in the odd quiz from time to time. 

- With the demand for pub quizzes rising throughout the country, a website where the challenger can cycle through 3 different levels of difficulty surrounding the same topic would be highly welcomed. 

## Wireframing

- Here are the screenshots of the initial wireframes I had created for the quiz website. I have drafted a wireframe for the landing page with the welcome text and registration form, as well as a wireframe for the quiz window.

- The use of wireframing is beneficial to myself and the reader. 
    - Firstly myself as this allows me to visualise how I want the website to look, and therefore I can begin consider how I will structure this with HTML and CSS. Once the design basics have been noted, I am able to visualise the JavaScript with a considerable amount of depth. Working to a plan presents better results.

    - Secondly, this will benefit the reader as it will allow them to see the thought process behind the features. Any final features that have changed compared to the wireframe will be documented with an explanation, giving the reader an insight as to why this has changed.

### Landing Page Wireframe

- **Background**
    - The background is set to be an image of the White House with a gray gradient over the top of it. This is to fit the aesthetic of the quiz being a historical theme focused around American history. The gray gradient over the image will further reinforce this.
    - Furthermore, gray is a high constrast color this meaning that the majority of colors used will provide an excellent contrast against this background. Not only will this aid visually-impaired users, this will also produce a sleek design capable of adopting almost any color pallet. 

- **Welcome Text**
    - Within the box titled 'welcome text', the description of the websitev at hand can be found, giving the user a sucinct insight of what to expect within the website.
    - A prompt encouraging the user to scroll down will be present too, advising them to scroll down and begin the quiz.
    - In terms of style, the box will have a white, curved border of 2pixels, giving it a contrast to the aforementioned gray background of the body. The text within this box will also be white, again giving it a contrast to the background allowing more accessiblity for the user.
